📊 Healthcare Workforce Mental Health: Burnout Risk Analytics & Department Profiling
🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes burnout frequency, job satisfaction, and mental health trends among healthcare employees using a real-world dataset. The goal is to identify high-risk departments, evaluate key workplace stressors, and offer data-driven insights to support workforce wellness and retention strategies.

🎯 Objectives
Segment employees based on burnout frequency and departmental distribution

Analyze correlation between burnout, stress levels, job satisfaction, and turnover intention

Evaluate how workplace factors (like workload) affect mental health metrics

📌 Key Insights
ICU (47.1%), General Practice (43.5%), and General Medicine (38.2%) reported the highest burnout frequency (‘Often’), making them the most vulnerable departments.

Employees experiencing burnout "Often" had ~30% lower job satisfaction than those with rare burnout.

"Heavy Workload" emerged as the most damaging workplace factor with:

Avg. Stress Level: 8.3 / 10

Mental Health Absences: 5.6 days/year

Job Satisfaction: 4.1 / 10

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy – Data Manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data Visualization

EDA, Grouping, Pivoting, Heatmaps – Analytical Techniques
